Overview
=========


The Moildev Library is a comprehensive set of functions designed to facilitate the development of fisheye image applications.
Originally created for the C++ programming language, the library has evolved to adapt to the changing preferences of developers over the past decade.
Given Python's immense popularity among developers in recent years, we recognized the need to expand the Moildev library's capabilities and make it accessible to Python users as well.
As a result, we are now actively developing and enhancing the Moildev Library for Python,
ensuring that Python developers can harness its power and versatility for their fisheye image projects with ease and efficiency.
